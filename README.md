# 🤖 LLM Chatbot using Pre-trained Language Model

This project showcases the implementation of a conversational chatbot powered by a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM). It demonstrates how to build an interactive, intelligent bot using Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch.

## 📌 Overview

The goal of this project is to create a chatbot that can engage in human-like conversations by leveraging transfer learning through pre-trained language models such as GPT-2 or DialoGPT.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch

## 📂 Project Structure

- `research_paper_of_LLM_Bot_using_pre_trained_model_.ipynb` — Main notebook implementing the chatbot logic, explanation, and testing.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shuvadip007/LLM-chatbot.git
cd LLM-chatbot
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

### 3. Run the Notebook

You can open the notebook using Jupyter or directly in Google Colab.

```bash
jupyter notebook research_paper_of_LLM_Bot_using_pre_trained_model_.ipynb
```


## 🧠 How It Works

- Loads a pre-trained model from Hugging Face (e.g., `microsoft/DialoGPT-small` or `gpt2`)
- Tokenizes the user input
- Generates context-aware responses
- Supports multi-turn conversation using dialogue history

## 💬 Sample Interaction

```text
User: Hello, who are you?
Bot: I am a language model trained to assist you. How can I help today?
```
